export const faqs = [
  { question: "What makes HLS different from other security companies?", answer: "HLS provides complete protection — not just installation. We combine advanced intruder alarm systems with professional 24/7 monitoring and rapid armed response. This means every alarm is verified by a live operator and met with immediate physical response, not just a phone call." },
  { question: "How quickly does armed response arrive?", answer: "Our armed response teams are strategically positioned across our service areas. The average response time is under 8 minutes from alarm verification. All our officers are licensed, trained, and GPS-tracked for accountability." },
  { question: "Do you offer security solutions for both homes and businesses?", answer: "Yes. HLS designs and installs security systems for residential, commercial, industrial, and enterprise clients. From single-family homes to multi-site corporate facilities, we tailor every solution to the specific needs and risk profile of the property." },
  { question: "What happens when an alarm is triggered?", answer: "When an alarm activates, the signal is instantly transmitted to our 24/7 monitoring center. A live operator verifies the alarm (often using video verification), and if confirmed, immediately dispatches armed response and contacts you and your emergency contacts." },
  { question: "Do you provide maintenance for existing security systems?", answer: "Yes. We offer preventive maintenance, annual maintenance contracts (AMC), and emergency repair services for both HLS-installed systems and existing systems from other providers. Our AMC plans include priority support and discounted parts." },
  { question: "Can I monitor my security system remotely?", answer: "Absolutely. All HLS systems include a mobile app that lets you view live camera feeds, arm/disarm your system, receive push notifications, and manage access — all from your smartphone, tablet, or computer, anywhere in the world." },
  { question: "How much does a security system cost?", answer: "Every property is unique, so we provide custom quotes based on your specific needs. We offer free security assessments and transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Contact us to schedule your free assessment and receive a detailed quote." },
  { question: "Are your systems compatible with smart home automation?", answer: "Yes. Our security systems integrate seamlessly with home automation including lighting, climate, smart locks, and voice control. You can create scenes that arm your security system, lock doors, and adjust lighting all at once." },
